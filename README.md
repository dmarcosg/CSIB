# Contextual Semantic Interpretability (CSIB)

This code allows to train a CNN model to predict a good map of penalizations for the different term of an Active Contour Model (ACM) such that the result gets close to a set of ground truth contours, as presented in [[1]](#marcos2020) (to appear in ACCV 2020). 

A preprint of the paper can be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08720.pdf
